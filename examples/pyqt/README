This is an example that uses PyQt4 binary packages.

To make the installer on a non-Windows system, first run fetch_pyqt_windows.sh.
This will download a PyQt Windows installer from Sourceforge, unpack the files
from it, and copy the necessary ones into pynsist_pkgs where pynsist will
pick them up.
