Release notes
=============

Version 0.2
-----------

* Python 2 support, thanks to `Johannes Baiter <https://github.com/jbaiter>`_
* Ability to define multiple shortcuts for one application.
* Validate config files to produce more helpful errors, thanks to
  `Tom Wallroth <https://github.com/devsnd>`_.
* Errors starting the application, such as missing libraries, are now written
  to a log file in the application directory, so you can work out what
  happened.
