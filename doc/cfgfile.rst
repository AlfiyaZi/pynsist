The Config File
===============

All paths in the config file are relative to the directory where the config
file is located, unless noted otherwise.

Application section
-------------------

.. describe:: name

  The user-readable name of your application. This will be used for various
  display purposes in the installer, and for shortcuts and the folder in
  'Program Files'.

.. describe:: version

  The version number of your application.

.. describe:: entry_point

   The function to launch your application, in the format ``module:function``.
   Dots are allowed in the module part. pynsist will create a script like this,
   plus some boilerplate::

       from module import function
       function()

.. describe:: script

   Path to the Python script which launches your application.

   Ensure that this boilerplate code is at the top of your script::

       #!python3.3
       import sys
       sys.path.insert(0, 'pkgs')

   The first line tells it which version of Python to run with. If you use
   binary packages, packages compiled for Python 3.3 won't work with Python 3.4.
   The other lines make sure it can find the packages installed along with your
   application.

.. note::
   Either ``entry_point`` or ``script`` must be specified, but not both. Specifying
   ``entry_point`` is normally easier and more reliable.

.. describe:: icon (optional)

  Path to a ``.ico`` file to be used for shortcuts to your application. pynsis
  has a default generic icon, but you probably want to replace it.

.. describe:: console (optional)

   If ``true``, shortcuts will be created using the ``py`` launcher, which opens
   a console for the process. If ``false``, or not specified, they will use the
   ``pyw`` launcher, which doesn't create a console.

.. _cfg_python:

Python section
--------------

.. describe:: version

  The Python version to download and bundle with your application. At present,
  this needs to be at least ``3.3.0``.

.. describe:: bitness (optional)

  ``32`` or ``64``, to use 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) Python. On Windows, this
  defaults to the version you're using, so that compiled modules will match. On
  other platforms, it defaults to 32-bit.

Include section
---------------

.. describe:: packages (optional)

   A list of importable package and module names to include in the installer.
   Specify only top-level packages, i.e. without a ``.`` in the name.

.. describe:: files (optional)

   Extra files to be installed with your application.

Build section
-------------

.. describe:: directory (optional)

   The build directory. Defaults to ``build/nsis/``.

.. describe:: installer_name (optional)

   The filename of the installer, relative to the build directory. The default
   is made from your application name and version.

.. describe:: nsi_template (optional)

   The path of a template .nsi file to specify further details of the installer.
   The default template is `part of pynsist <https://github.com/takluyver/pynsist/blob/master/nsist/template.nsi>`_.

   pynsist will add a definitions section at the top of the template, and look
   for tags ``;EXTRA_FILES_INSTALL`` and ``;EXTRA_FILES_UNINSTALL`` to insert lists
   of extra files and folders to be installed. See the
   `NSIS Scripting Reference <http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Chapter4.html>`_
   for details of the format.
